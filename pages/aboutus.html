    <p>
        
        Welcome to Anichat!

        Anichat builds technology and services that allow people to get in touch with each other, build communities and develop companies. These terms apply to your use of Anichat.
        
        We do not charge you for using Anichat or the other products and services covered by these terms. Instead, companies and organizations pay us to show you ads about their products and services. By using our products, you agree that we may show you ads that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. We use personal information to more easily determine which ads we should show you.
        
        We do not sell your personal information to advertisers, and we do not share information that directly identifies you (such as name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you specifically give us permission. Instead, advertisers can inform us about things like what kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports on the performance of their ads, which helps them understand how people interact with the content. See section 2 below for more information.
        
        Our data policy explains how we collect and use your personal information to determine some of the ads you see and provide all other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the confidentiality choices you have made about how we use your information.
        
         </p>
